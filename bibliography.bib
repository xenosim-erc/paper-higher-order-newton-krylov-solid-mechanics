	abstract = {On January 7th, 2022, a historical event of pig-to-human cardiac xenotransplantation was performed using genetically engineered porcine xenograft and co-stimulation blockade-based immunosuppression. Though the patient developed xenograft failure and succumbed to death on post-operative day 60, this event shed light on the cumulative effect of scientists and physicians who worked hard to unveil the underlying immunobiology of cross-species organ transplantation. In this review, we will summarize major advances along the history of cardiac xenotransplantation, current status in Korea, and remaining challenges., Along with the development of immunosuppressive drugs, major advances on xenotransplantation were achieved by understanding the immunobiology of xenograft rejection. Most importantly, three predominant carbohydrate antigens on porcine endothelial cells were key elements provoking hyperacute rejection: α1,3-galactose, SDa blood group antigen, and N-glycolylneuraminic acid. Preformed antibodies binding to the porcine major xenoantigen causes complement activation and endothelial cell activation, leading to xenograft injury and intravascular thrombosis. Recent advances in genetic engineering enabled knock-outs of these major xenoantigens, thus producing xenografts with less hyperacute rejection rates. Another milestone in the history of xenotransplantation was the development of co-stimulation blockaded strategy. Unlike allotransplantation, xenotransplantation requires blockade of CD40-CD40L pathway to prevent T-cell dependent B-cell activation and antibody production. In 2010s, advanced genetic engineering of xenograft by inducing the expression of multiple human transgenes became available. So-called ‘multi-gene’ xenografts expressing human transgenes such as thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor were introduced, which resulted in the reduction of thrombotic events and improvement of xenograft survival. Still, there are many limitations to clinical translation of cardiac xenotransplantation. Along with technical challenges, zoonotic infection and physiological discordances are major obstacles. Social barriers including healthcare costs also need to be addressed. Although there are several remaining obstacles to overcome, xenotransplantation would surely become the novel option for millions of patients with end-stage heart failure who have limited options to traditional therapeutics.},

Windkessels are used as hydraulic load for isolated hearts and in studies of the entire circulation. Furthermore, they are used to estimate total arterial compliance from pressure and flow; several of these methods are reviewed. Windkessels describe the general features of the input impedance, with physiologically interpretable parameters. Since it is a lumped model it is not suitable for the assessment of spatially distributed phenomena and aspects of wave travel, but it is a simple and fairly accurate approximation of ventricular afterload.},

This chapter compares the blood vessel wall of an artery with that of a vein and a capillary, and lists the different types of capillaries, providing examples. It describes the characteristics of each type of blood vessel: artery, arteriole, capillary, venule, and vein, and then summarizes the mechanisms involved in allowing the blood to flow. This chapter covers the role of peripheral resistance and blood pressure in the regulation of blood flow, the various factors associated with blood flow, and the capillary exchange system, including the forces involved in this process. It also captures the role of the lymphatic system in capillary exchange, and the role played by the skeletal muscle pump and respiratory pump in relation to venous return.

In addition, we also incorporated the effects of the head loss at the two inlets of the large coronary arteries for the first time. The head loss could explain the phenomenon of a sudden increase of the resistance at the inlet of coronary vessel. The estimated blood pressure and flow rate results from the model agree well with the clinical measurements. The computed impedances also match the experimental perfusion measurement. The effects of coronary arterial stenosis are considered and the fractional flow reserve and relative flow in the coronary vessels for a stenotic vessel computed in this model show good agreement with published experimental data. It is believed that the approach could be readily translated to clinical practice to facilitate real time clinical diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Physics-based models can be applied to describe mechanisms in both health and disease, which has the potential to accelerate the development of personalized medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of personalizing a model of systemic hemodynamics by estimating model parameters. We investigated the feasibility of estimating model parameters for a closed-loop lumped parameter model of the left heart and systemic circulation using the step-wise subset reduction method. This proceeded by first investigating the structural identifiability of the model parameters. Secondly, we performed sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters were most influential on the most relevant model outputs. Finally, we constructed a sequence of progressively smaller subsets including parameters based on their ranking by model output influence. The model was then optimized to data for each set of parameters to evaluate how well the parameters could be estimated for each subset. The subsequent results allowed assessment of how different data sets, and noise affected the parameter estimates. In the noiseless case, all parameters could be calibrated to less than 10−3\% error using time series data, while errors using clinical index data could reach over 100\%. With 5\% normally distributed noise the accuracy was limited to be within 10\% error for the five most sensitive parameters, while the four least sensitive parameters were unreliably estimated for waveform data. The three least sensitive parameters were particularly challenging to estimate so these should be prioritized for measurement. Cost functions based on time series such as pressure waveforms, were found to give better parameter estimates than cost functions based on standard indices used in clinical assessment of the cardiovascular system, for example stroke volume (SV) and pulse pressure (PP). Averaged parameter estimate errors were reduced by several orders of magnitude by choosing waveforms for noiseless synthetic data. Also when measurement data were noisy, the parameter estimation procedure based on continuous waveforms was more accurate than that based on clinical indices. By application of the stepwise subset reduction method we demonstrated that by the addition of venous pressure to the cost function, or conversely fixing the systemic venous compliance parameter at an accurate value improved all parameter estimates, especially the diastolic filling parameters which have least influence on the aortic pressure.},

Lumped parameter modelling has been widely used to simulate cardiac function and physiological scenarios in cardiovascular research. Whereas several patient-specific lumped parameter models have been reported for adults, there is a limited number of studies aiming to simulate cardiac function in children. The aim of this study is to simulate patient-specific cardiovascular dynamics in children diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, using a lumped parameter model.

Methods
Patient data including age, gender, heart rate, left and right ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, cardiac output, systolic and diastolic aortic pressures were collected from 3 patients at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UK. Ventricular geometrical data were additionally retrieved from cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. 23 parameters in the lumped parameter model were optimised to simulate systolic and diastolic pressures, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes, cardiac output and left and right ventricular diameters in the patients using a direct search optimisation method.

Results
Difference between the haemodynamic parameters in the optimised cardiovascular system models and clinical data was less than 10\%.

Conclusion
The simulation results show the potential of patient-specific lumped parameter modelling to simulate clinical cases. Modelling patient specific cardiac function and blood flow in the paediatric patients would allow us to evaluate a variety of physiological scenarios and treatment options.},

	abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the fatal diseases among various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Early diagnosis of this cardiac condition is the need of the hour for saving patients’ lives. Coronary angiography is the gold standard clinical method for detecting a blockage in the coronary artery. However, it is an invasive and costly procedure. Due to these limitations, it cannot be used for preventive screening of the general population. In this study, an intelligent predictive model is proposed to diagnose CAD via lumped parameter modelling (LPM) of the human heart. Only non-invasive measurements are used to get a subject-specific CVS model. Here, the clinical data related to the subject and the derived CVS parameters are merged to generate a feature set for the classification of CAD and non-CAD subjects. Four different algorithms are used, namely Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest (RF) classifier, to select the best-performed classification model. For the given data set, the RF classifier is found to work best among these in terms of all performance measures. The classification model is built using ten-fold cross-validation (CV) on the training set. The best performed RF classification model gives a ten-fold CV accuracy of (0.96 ± 0.057)\%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity over unseen test sets are 1 and 0.85, respectively. Apart from the CAD classification, the proposed method also can estimate subject-specific CVS model parameters truly non-invasively from signals like photoplethysmograph.},

The model is applied to study various degrees of aortic stenosis using typical human cardiovascular parameters. The predicted transvalvular pressure drops for the different modelling approaches are compared to typical measured mean and peak gradients found in literature for severely stenosed aortic valves. The comparison between the predicted and measured values show that the previously published valve models under predicts expected severely stenosed peak and mean transvalvular pressure drops by approximately 47\% and 25\% respectively, whereas the newly proposed model under predicts the peak pressure drop by 25\% and over predicts mean pressure drop by 7\%.},

In modelling the heart valve dynamics, the various factors that influence the valve motion are examined, and the governing differential equation for valve motion is derived. The heart valve model includes the influence of the blood pressure effect, the friction effect from the tissue, and from blood motion. As improvement from previous works, the contribution of the blood vortex effect in the vicinity of the valve leaflets to valve motion is specially considered. The proposed model is then used in simulation of healthy and certain pathological conditions such as mitral valve stenosis and aortic regurgitation.

Aortic wall stiffness is a variable often altered in DAD patients and potentially involved in long-term outcome. However, its relevance is still mostly unknown. To gain more detailed knowledge of how wall elasticity (compliance) might influence intraluminal haemodynamics in DAD, a lumped-parameter model was developed based on experimental data from a pulsatile hydraulic circuit and validated for 8 clinical scenarios. Next, the variations of intraluminal pressures and flows were assessed as a function of wall elasticity. In comparison with the most rigid-wall case, an increase in elasticity to physiological values was associated with a decrease in systolic and increase in diastolic pressures of up to 33\% and 63\% respectively, with a subsequent decrease in the pressure wave amplitude of up to 86\%. Moreover, it was related to an increase in multidirectional intraluminal flows and transition of behaviour as 2 parallel vessels towards a vessel with a side-chamber.

The W4P and W4S are derived from the three-element windkessel by connecting an inductance, L, in parallel or in series, respectively, with aortic characteristic impedance, Rc. In the IVW, L is placed in series at the input of a viscoelastic windkessel, incorporating a Voigt cell (a resistor, Rd, in series with a capacitor, C). Pressure and flow measured in the ascending aorta of five ferrets and five dogs were used to estimate all model parameters, by fitting to pressure. For each model structure, parameter-related GSFs were generated. Focusing on controversial L, Rc and Rd physical meaning, our GSF analysis yielded the conclusion that, in both the W4S and the IVW, but not in the W4P, the L-term is suitable to represent the inertial properties of blood motion. Moreover, the meaning of aortic characteristic impedance ascribed to Rc is questionable; while Rd is likely to account for viscous losses of arterial wall motion.},

	abstract = {On 3 December 1967, Christiaan Barnard performed the first heart transplantation in the world at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. In the succeeding months, heart transplantations in the USA, Asia and Europe followed. On 14 April 1969, Åke Senning successfully accomplished the first heart transplantation in Switzerland at the former Cantonal Hospital in Zurich. In the summer of 1969, he undertook a second heart transplantation. Although the surgical procedure went well technically, both patients died within weeks to months after transplantation. Causes of death were infection in the first and rejection in the second patient. Senning’s colleagues around the world had similar experiences. Survival after heart transplantation was unacceptably low. The heart transplant community recognised the lack of knowledge about immunological processes and appropriate immunosuppressive regimens as underlying reason for the early deaths. Most transplant centres decided to refrain from heart transplantation until sufficient immunological insight became available. After the introduction of the new immunosuppressive drug ciclosporin into the clinic and the availability of tools to monitor rejection in the early 1980s, heart transplant programmes were restarted all over the world. The legal recognition of brain death allowed procurement of donor hearts without exposure to warm ischaemia, and the principle of cold storage enabled prolongation of ischaemia time and acceptance of donors in distant hospitals, resulting in enlargement of the donor pool. In Switzerland, Marko Turina resumed heart transplantation in 1985 at Senning’s former workplace in Zurich. The number of heart transplants in Switzerland and in the world grew rapidly because the outcome markedly improved. Particularly over the long-term, survival in Zurich surpassed the outcome worldwide. Zurich created internationally recognised milestones such as transplantation of patients with grown-up congenital heart disease, the implementation of the bicaval instead of the right atrial anastomosis during the transplant procedure and the dual transplantation of one heart. Since the middle of the 1990s, however, the number of heart transplants has plateaued, mainly because of donor shortage. The current era is characterised by efforts to increase the number of donors. The utilisation of marginal donors, the change from informed to presumed consent for organ donation and donation after cardiocirculatory-determined death have been proposed to augment the donor pool.},

However, with the advent of immunosuppressive therapies and a better understanding of human anatomy and surgical techniques, cardiac transplantation started gaining popularity in the 1990s. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) reported maximum transplants during the period of 1993-2004; however, in recent years, the numbers reported have grown even further. With well-defined indications now set forth by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (ACC/AHA/HFSA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in collaboration with ISHLT, more people are on the waiting list than is the availability of the organ itself.

HHT has also been proposed to overcome pulmonary hypertension, to increase the size of the donor pool and to decrease waiting times without increasing morbidity caused by the procedure.

Finally, a second intervention is proposed, where a “twist” is performed to place the donor’s heart in an orthotopic position after re-moval of the native heart.

The initial technique, still called ‘standard technique’ is the biatrial one. In the late 1980s, alternatives like the ‘bicaval technique’ were developed in order to get a more anatomical result. In the present chapter, we will throw the reader into the early years of the cardiac transplantation era, describing all the efforts made by the “fathers” of the cardiac surgery in order to standardize techniques inherited by the modern surgeons. Afterwards, we will present a review of the literature to answer the question if the biatrial technique should still be called “standard technique”.},

	abstract = {Transgenic technology has potentially solved many of the immunological difficulties of using pig organs to support life in the human recipient. Nevertheless, other problems still remain. Knowledge of cardiac anatomy of the pig (Sus scrofa) is limited despite the general acceptance in the literature that it is similar to that of man. A qualitative analysis of porcine and human cardiac anatomy was achieved by gross examination and dissection of hearts with macrophotography. The porcine organ had a classic 'Valentine heart' shape, reflecting its location within the thorax and to the orientation of the pig's body (unguligrade stance). The human heart, in contrast, was trapezoidal in silhouette, reflecting man's orthograde posture. The morphologically right atrium of the pig was characterised by the tubular shape of its appendage (a feature observed on the left in the human heart). The porcine superior and inferior caval veins opened into the atrium at right angles to one another, whereas in man the orifices were directly in line. A prominent left azygous vein (comparable to the much reduced left superior caval or oblique vein in man) entered on the left side of the pig heart and drained via the coronary sinus. The porcine left atrium received only 2 pulmonary veins, whereas 4 orifices were generally observed in man. The sweep between the inlet and outlet components of the porcine right ventricle was less marked than in man, and a prominent muscular moderator band was situated in a much higher position within the porcine right ventricle compared with that of man. The apical components of both porcine ventricles possessed very coarse trabeculations, much broader than those observed in the human ventricles. In general, aortic-mitral fibrous continuity was reduced in the outlet component of the porcine left ventricle, with approximately two-thirds of the aortic valve being supported by left ventricular musculature. Several potentially significant differences exist between porcine and human hearts. It is important that these differences are considered as the arguments continue concerning the use of transgenic pig hearts for xenotransplantation.},

Consequently the discovery of new regimens and therapeutic interventions is of utmost importance. Research using human subjects is associated with substantial methodologic and ethical considerations, and the quest for an appropriate animal model for the human cardiovascular system has led to swine. The porcine heart bears a close resemblance to the human heart in terms of its coronary circulation and hemodynamic similarities and offers ease of implementation of methods and devices from human healthcare facilities. A thorough comprehension of the anatomy and physiology of the porcine cardiovascular system should focus on differences between swine and humans as well as similarities. Understanding these differences and similarities is essential to extrapolating data appropriately and to addressing the social demand for the ethical use of animals in biomedical research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To determine whether the pig is an appropriate experimental animal for studies on distal anastomotic connectors in coronary artery bypass surgery, the mechanical properties of young porcine and old human coronary and internal mammary arteries were compared within and beyond the physiologic range of strains.
METHODS: Coronary arteries from 6 humans and 8 pigs were studied as well as internal mammary arteries of 3 humans and 6 pigs (human, aged 61 to 85 years; pig, 78.7 +/- 5.8 kg [mean +/- SD]). Pressure-diameter, pressure-axial force, circumferential and axial stress-strain relations, and dimensions were measured.
RESULTS: The dimensions of the porcine and human coronary and internal mammary artery were generally similar but wall thickness was smaller in the porcine internal mammary artery (0.35 +/- 0.07 mm versus 0.71 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively, p = 0.002). The porcine internal mammary artery wall was less elastic than the coronary artery wall, whereas in humans both arteries displayed similar elasticity. Overall the porcine arteries were far more elastic in both circumferential and axial direction compared with the human arteries. Consequently the porcine arteries could be safely stretched by 60\% to 70\% compared with about 20\% for the human arteries before reaching their maximum circumferential strain.
CONCLUSIONS: The three times greater elasticity of porcine compared with human coronary and internal mammary artery walls may result in underestimation of wall stress and the risk of wall injury when coronary connectors that involve overstretching of the wall are evaluated in the pig.},

The effect of trabecular cutting was also analyzed with finite-element model (FEM) simulations. Our results demonstrated that LV compliance improved after trabecular cutting (p {\textless} 0.001). Finite-element simulations further demonstrated that stiffer trabeculae reduce LV compliance further, and that the presence of trabeculae reduced the wall stress in the apex. In conclusion, we demonstrate that integrity of the LV and trabeculae is important to maintain LV stiffness and loss in trabeculae leads to more LV compliance.},

	abstract = {Objective
To establish the normal criterion of ascending aortic diameter (AAOD) measured by 64 Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) and Electron Beam Computed Tomography (EBT) based on gender and age.

Methods
1442 consecutive subjects who were referred for evaluation of possible coronary artery disease underwent coronary CT angiography (CTA) and coronary artery calcium scanning (CACS) (55+11 years, 65\% male) without known coronary heart disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary and renal disease, diabetes and severe aortic calcification. The ascending aortic diameter, descending aortic diameter (DAOD), pulmonary artery (PAD) and chest anterioposterior diameter (CAPD), posterior border of sternal bone to anterior border of spine, were measured at the slice level of mid right pulmonary artery by using end systolic trigger image. The volume of four chambers, ejection fraction of left ventricle, and cardiac output were measured in 56\% of the patients. Patients demographic information, age, gender, weight, height and body surface area (BSA), were recorded. The mean value and age specific and gender adjusted upper normal limits (mean + 2 standard deviations) were calculated. The linear correlation analysis was done between AAOD and all parameters. The reproducibility, wall thickness and difference between end systole and diastole were calculated.

Result
AAOD has significant linear association with age, gender, descending aortic diameter and pulmonary artery diameter (P{\textless}0.05). There is no significant correlation between AAOD and body surface area, four chamber volume, LVEF, CO and CAPD. The mean Intra-luminal AAOD was 31.1 ± 3.9mm and 33.6 ± 4.1 mm in females and males respectively. The upper normal limits (mean + 2 standard deviations) of Intra-luminal AAOD, mean+ standard deviation, was 35.6, 38.3 and 40 mm for females and 37.8, 40.5 and 42.6 mm for males in age group 20 to 40, 41 to 60, above 60 year respectively. Intra-luminal should parallel echocardiography and invasive angiography. Traditional cross sectional imaging (with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) includes the vessel wall. The mean total AAOD was 33.5mm and 36.0 mm in females and males respectively. The upper normal limits (mean + 2 standard deviations) of Intra-luminal AAOD, mean+ standard deviation, was 38.0, 40.7 and 42.4 mm for females and 40.2, 42.9 and 45.0 mm for males in age group 20 to 40, 41 to 60, above 60 year respectively. The inter and intra observer, scanner and repeated measurement variability was low (R value {\textgreater}0.91, P{\textless}0.001, coefficient variation {\textless}3.2\%). AAOD was 1.7 mm less in end-diastole than end systole(P{\textless}0.001).

Conclusion
The ascending aortic diameter increases with age and male gender. Gender specific and age adjusted normals for aortic diameters are necessary to differentiate pathologic atherosclerotic changes in the ascending aorta. Use of intra-luminal or total aortic diameter values depends on the comparison study that may be employed.},

We aimed to assess PA diameters, identify a threshold for normal diameters, define PA aneurysms, possible predictors of PA size and evaluate the correlation with mid-ascending aortic diameters.Between April 2018 and August 2019, 497 consecutive patients who underwent whole-body computed tomographic angiography were reviewed. Clinical and imaging data were collected from our institutional database. Precise three-dimensional centreline measurements were taken. Linear regression analysis was performed to detect parameters associated with PA diameter. A two-stage model was created to identify potential predictors and the resulting statistically significant interactions were tested. Data were grouped and PA, standard deviation, and upper normal limits were calculated.Among 497 patients with an average age of 51.4 (20.2) (74.6\% males), the mean PA diameter measured 32.0 (4.6) mm [female: 31.2 (4.7) mm vs male: 32.2 (4.5) mm; P = 0.032]. The mean PA length, left PA and right PA diameters were similar between male and female patients. We found a significant correlation (r = 0.352; P \&lt; 0.001) between the PAs and mid-ascending aortic diameters. Body surface area (P = 0.032, β =  4.52 [0.40; 8.64] 95\% CI) was the only significant influencing variable for PA diameter.The normal mean PA diameter in a reference cohort is 32.0 (4.6) mm. Body surface area is the only influencing variable of PA diameter. The normal diameters measured and corresponding upper limits of normal revealed that a PA aneurysm should not be considered below a threshold of 45 mm.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To generate normal reference values for left ventricular mid-diastolic wall thickness (LV-MDWT) measured by using CT angiography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: LV-MDWT was measured in 2383 consecutive patients, without structural heart disease, undergoing prospective electrocardiographically (ECG) triggered mid-diastolic coronary CT angiography. LV-MDWT was manually measured on automatically segmented short-axis images according to the American Heart Association's 17-segment model. Commercially available automatic software was used to calculate the left ventricular (LV) mass.
RESULTS: Among the 2383 patients, average LV-MDWT was 7.24 mm ± 1.86 (standard deviation [SD]), with the basal anteroseptal segment being the thickest wall (8.71 mm ± 2.19) and the apical inferior segment being the thinnest wall (5.9 mm ± 1.58; P {\textless} .001). Over all LV segments, the maximum upper limit, as defined as 2 SD above the mean, was 13.6 mm for men (LV1) and 11.2 mm for women. For men, only the basal anterior segment was above 13 mm. There was a significant difference in average LV-MDWT between women and men with 6.47 mm ± 1.07 and 7.90 mm ± 1.24, respectively (P {\textless} .001). Significant differences in LV-MDWT were found in the subgroups aged less than 65 years and greater than or equal to 65 years (P {\textless} .001). There was a strong correlation between LV-MDWT and LV mass (P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: Normal sex- and age-specific reference ranges for LV-MDWT in prospective ECG-triggered mid-diastolic coronary CT angiography have been provided. These benchmarks may expand the diagnostic and prognostic roles of CT angiography, beyond its role in the identification of coronary artery disease.© RSNA, 2019.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Echocardiography played an important role in the screening and diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the study reported here, we attempted to evaluate the effects of birth season, breed, sex, and sire family on cardiac morphology determined in pigs by use of echocardiography.
METHODS: A total of 411 pigs (mean body weight and age of 105.7 +/- 10.6 kg and 214.4 +/- 25.5 days, respectively) with different genetic backgrounds (Landrace, Yorkshire, and their two-way crossbred) were studied. Cardiac morphologic measurements included thickness of left ventricle and interventricular septum at end-systolic and end-diastolic phases. Meanwhile, the statistical model included the following effects: birth season, breed, sex, interaction between breed and sex, sire family, body weight, and age.
RESULTS: Mean cardiac morphologic measurements were as follows: thickness of the interventricular septum at end-systolic and end-diastolic phases was 1.74 and 1.14 cm, respectively; and thickness of the left ventricular free wall at end-systolic and end-diastolic phases was 1.81 and 0.98 cm, respectively. Medium positive correlations existed among the cardiac morphologic measurements r = 0.31 to 0.53; P {\textless} 0.001). Pigs born in spring had significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) lower cardiac thickness at the end systolic phase than did pigs born in other seasons, and Landrace pigs had higher cardiac morphologic measurements than did Yorkshire and two-way crossbred pigs. Additionally, thickness of interventricular septum at the end-diastolic phase in male pigs was significantly higher than that in female pigs (P {\textless} 0.05). Cardiac morphologic measurements for the sire family were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) different, and contributed 77.2 to 87.9\% of the total variation, suggesting that genetic variation in cardiac morphology might exist in pigs.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac morphology of pigs might be influenced by genetic background. The effects of birth season, breed, sire family, and sex should be adjusted when using pigs as an animal model for comparative cardiovascular studies.},

The measurements were made at the distal tips of the filter tines on postplacement radiographs. Magnification corrections were made using the filter tine lengths as references. The overall mean diameter was 20 mm, the range was 13 to 30 mm, and the standard deviation was 3 mm. Two cavae (3\%) were more than 28 mm in diameter. A previous in vitro study has shown that in venae cavae of this size there is a significant risk of reduced clot-capturing ability with the KG filter and migration with the Mobin-Uddin filter. Thus it is important to evaluate vena caval diameter by cavography prior to filter placement.},

	abstract = {Objective: To develop a large animal model of iliocaval deep venous thrombosis (DVT), which enables development and evaluation of interventional management and existing imaging modalities.
Methods: The experimental protocol consisted of a total endovascular approach. Pigs were percutaneously accessed through the right internal jugular and bilateral femoral veins. Three balloon catheters were inﬂated to induce venous stasis in the infrarenal inferior vena cava (IVC) and bilateral common iliac veins (CIVs). Hypercoagulability was induced by injecting 10 000 IU of thrombin. After 2.5 hours, the balloon catheters were removed before animal recovery. After seven, 14, 21, 28, or 35 days, animals were euthanised; the IVC and CIV were harvested en bloc, cross sectioned and prepared for histological examination. Multimodal imaging was performed before and after thrombus creation, and before animal euthanasia.
Results: Thirteen female domestic pigs with a mean weight of 59.3 kilograms were used. The mean maximum IVC diameter and area were 16.4 mm and 1.2 cm2, respectively. The procedure was successful in 12 animals with occlusive venous thrombosis in the region of interest on immediate post-operative magnetic resonance venography and a mean thrombus volume of 19.8 cm3. Clinical pathology results showed platelet consumption, D dimer increase, and inﬂammatory response. Histological evaluation demonstrated a red cell, ﬁbrin, and platelet rich thrombus on day 1, with progressive inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration from day 7. Collagen deposition appeared in week 2 and neovascularisation in week 3.
Conclusion: Endovascular occlusion combined with thrombin infusion is a reliable minimally invasive approach to produce acute and subacute DVT in a large animal model.},

One dimensional (1D) mathematical models, based on systems of two partial differential equations for each arterial segment suitably matched at bifurcations, can be simulated with low computational costs and provide useful insights into the role of wave reflections. Some recent works have indeed moved in this direction. The specific contribution of the present paper is to illustrate a 1D numerical model numerically coupled with a model for the heart action. Typically, the action of the heart on the arterial system is modelled as a boundary condition at the entrance of the aorta. However, the left ventricle (LV) and the vascular network are a strongly coupled single mechanical system. This coupling can be relevant in the numerical description of pressure waves propagation, particularly when dealing with pathological situations. In this work, we propose a simple lumped parameter model for the heart and show how it can be coupled numerically with a 1D model for the arteries. Numerical results actually confirm the relevant impact of the heart-arteries coupling in realistic simulations.},

	abstract = {This review paper addresses the so called geometric multiscale approach for the numerical simulation of blood flow problems, from its origin (that we can collocate in the second half of ’90s) to our days. By this approach the blood fluid-dynamics in the whole circulatory system is described mathematically by means of heterogeneous problems featuring different degree of detail and different geometric dimension that interact together through appropriate interface coupling conditions. Our review starts with the introduction of the stand-alone problems, namely the 3D fluid–structure interaction problem, its reduced representation by means of 1D models, and the so-called lumped parameters (aka 0D) models, where only the dependence on time survives. We then address specific methods for stand-alone 3D models when the available boundary data are not enough to ensure the mathematical well posedness. These so-called “defective problems” naturally arise in practical applications of clinical relevance but also because of the interface coupling of heterogeneous problems that are generated by the geometric multiscale process. We also describe specific issues related to the boundary treatment of reduced models, particularly relevant to the geometric multiscale coupling. Next, we detail the most popular numerical algorithms for the solution of the coupled problems. Finally, we review some of the most representative works–from different research groups–which addressed the geometric multiscale approach in the past years. A proper treatment of the different scales relevant to the hemodynamics and their interplay is essential for the accuracy of numerical simulations and eventually for their clinical impact. This paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art picture of these topics, where the gap between theory and practice demands rigorous mathematical models to be reliably filled.},

When the aortic valve is open, the coupled multidomain method is used to strongly couple the lumped parameter heart model and three-dimensional arterial models and compute ventricular volume, ventricular pressure, aortic flow, and aortic pressure. The shape of the velocity profiles of the inlet boundary and the outlet boundaries that experience retrograde flow are constrained to achieve a robust algorithm. When the aortic valve is closed, the inflow boundary condition is switched to a zero velocity Dirichlet condition. With this method, we obtain physiologically realistic aortic flow and pressure waveforms.

Fluid-structure interaction algorithms are utilized to examine how the human circulatory system functions by simulating blood flow and capturing mechanical responses within blood vessels. These sophisticated algorithms take into account interactions between fluid dynamics, vessel walls, heart walls, and valves. By combining advanced medical imaging techniques with fluid-structure interaction models, it becomes possible to customize these models for individual patients. This customization enables clinicians to create personalized treatment plans. In this comprehensive article review, we explore various applications of fluid-structure interaction models in studying the cardiovascular system.

Abstract
Using fluid-structure interaction algorithms to simulate the human circulatory system is an innovative approach that can provide valuable insights into cardiovascular dynamics. Fluid-structure interaction algorithms enable us to couple simulations of blood flow and mechanical responses of the blood vessels while taking into account interactions between fluid dynamics and structural behaviors of vessel walls, heart walls, or valves. In the context of the human circulatory system, these algorithms offer a more comprehensive representation by considering the complex interplay between blood flow and the elasticity of blood vessels. Algorithms that simulate fluid flow dynamics and the resulting forces exerted on vessel walls can capture phenomena such as wall deformation, arterial compliance, and the propagation of pressure waves throughout the cardiovascular system. These models enhance the understanding of vasculature properties in human anatomy. The utilization of fluid-structure interaction methods in combination with medical imaging can generate patient-specific models for individual patients to facilitate the process of devising treatment plans. This review evaluates current applications and implications of fluid-structure interaction algorithms with respect to the vasculature, while considering their potential role as a guidance tool for intervention procedures.},

The dream of transferring bodily organs from animals to humans goes back to antiquity, as articulated in the myth of Daedalus and Icarus. But the genuine possibility of xenotransplantation is largely a creature of the last half-century. That possibility raises a plethora of genuine ethical issues, as well as spurious ones occasioned by societal ignorance of science.

Abstract
There are three sorts of issues associated with genetic engineering and, by implication, with xenotransplantation. These are dangers associated with the technology, animal welfare issues, and the claim that genetic engineering represents a technology that humans should not embark upon. Using the hearts of pigs for humans in need of transplants has been a major issue in xenotransplantation. There are dangers associated with such use, such as immunological rejection of the organ, endogenous viruses infecting the recipients, and issues of privacy. In addition, the issue of fair distribution of organs arises. Animal welfare issues also arise, most notably the living conditions of the donor animals, issues notably present in confinement agriculture. A major issue emerges from animals’ being kept under conditions that fail to meet the needs dictated by the animals’ biological and psychological natures. Xenotransplantation animals will be kept under deprived laboratory conditions that similarly fail to meet the animals’ natures. This is a significant concern for society in general. There are also issues of “bad ethics” arising from scientists’ disavowal of ethical concerns in science. This in turn, coupled with societal ignorance of science, creates a climate for proliferation of religious and other non-rational concerns, such as the claim that xenotransplantation violates God’s will. These spurious concerns can only be ameliorated when public understanding of science improves, and scientific understanding of ethics increases.},

Cox regression analysis of 216 consecutive patients receiving OHT between August 1987 and January 2010 identified only recipient age at the time of transplant to be an independent predictor of mortality (P = 0.048, odds ratio = 1.04). After a mean follow-up of 96.6 ± 77.7 months, 108 patients were alive, of which 35 were found to be eligible for MRI assessment. In this analysis, left and right atrial volumes were found to be significantly larger in the standard group in comparison with the bicaval group (P = 0.001), and no significant difference between the two techniques was observed in left and right atrio-ventricular output. Moreover, a significantly reduced accuracy was observed (CCC {\textless} 0.3) when TTE results were compared with MRI assessment in evaluating atrial dimensions. Although left and right atrial volumes are significantly larger in the standard group in comparison with the bicaval group, we concluded that no significant difference in the atrial output and survival between the two techniques could be demonstrated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) is the gold standard treatment in end-stage heart disease. Controversy remains whether bicaval OHT is superior to biatrial OHT in both early and late outcomes. This study aimed to provide an overview of the early and late outcomes in patients who underwent a bicaval or biatrial OHT.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed for articles published before December 2017. Studies comparing adult patients undergoing biatrial OHT and bicaval OHT were included. Early outcomes were pooled in odds ratios and late outcomes were pooled in rate ratios. Late survival was visualized by a pooled Kaplan-Meier curve.
RESULTS: A total of 36 publications were included in the meta-analysis, counting 3555 patients undergoing biatrial OHT and 3208 patients undergoing bicaval OHT. Early outcomes in mortality, tricuspid regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and permanent pacemaker implantation differed significantly in favor of the bicaval OHT patients. Long-term survival was significantly better in patients undergoing bicaval vs biatrial OHT (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-1.6; P = .008). Also, late tricuspid regurgitation was less frequently seen in the bicaval OHT patients (rate ratio, 2.14; 95\% CI, 1.17-3.94; P = .014).
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review with meta-analysis shows that bicaval OHT results in more favorable early and late outcomes for patients undergoing a bicaval OHT compared with a biatrial OHT. Therefore, bicaval OHT should be considered as preferable technique for OHT.},
